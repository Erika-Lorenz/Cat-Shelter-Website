        <br>    
        <p>C.A.T.S., a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit since 2008, helps to save the lives of approximately 400 area cats and kittens each year through rescue, foster, trap-neuter-return, and by placing them in caring, lifelong homes. Adoption fees from $30 to $75 help defray the cost of care for the animals. Donations from interested individuals, organizations and business provide additional financial support. Our application process ensures that every adopted animal is placed in an environment where there is appropriate space, human contact, and a commitment to safeguard and care for the animal for its entire lifetime. Our standards are high. The welfare of the animals is paramount in the placement process.</p>

        <p>Cats and kittens come from various sources and situations: orphans found under a deck, an abandoned cat crying at the door, pets no longer able to stay with a family because someone has developed allergies or is moving to a place where the cats are not welcome. Some come from the rescue community, finding tame cats and kittens feeding with feral colonies. Newborn or senior, healthy, ill or injured, all are valued at C.A.T.S. Incoming cats and kittens are examined for general health, illness, injury, parasites and tested for feline viral diseases and provided appropriate medical care. Daily care of cats and kittens is done both in the shelter and in the foster homes of volunteers, sometimes involving bottle-feeding orphans, often requiring intensive medical care of ill animal</p>

        <p>C.A.T.S. provides a safe haven and socialization as well as proper nutrition and a clean environment while the animals await adoptive homes. Our volunteers speak with the public, interview prospective adopters, and provide education concerning the care of pets on such subjects as spaying/neutering, introducing a new pet into the family, addressing behavioral issues, proper daily care and well-cat/kitten care.</p>

        <p>Each year C.A.T.S. is faced with the impossible and each and every day we recommit ourselves to something we truly believe in, the mission we adopted at our inception, to save the lives of area cats and kittens through rescue, foster, trap-neuter-return, and to place them in caring, lifelong homes.</p>

        <br>    
        <p>Our mission encompasses the following goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To rescue those cats and kittens in danger of losing their lives in shelters and on the streets.</li>
            <li>To provide needed veterinary care; to provide foster care, to find loving, lifetime homes.</li>
            <li>To educate the public about pet overpopulation and the importance of spaying/neutering.</li>
            <li>To improve the quality of life for cats.</li>
            <li>To provide and promote TNR (trap, neuter, return) of feral cats where there are caretakers as an       alternative to euthanasia.</li>

        <br>    
        <h5>Beginnings.</h5>
        <p>I named her Mandy. She was a beautiful Tabby and her and her four kittens were to be euthanized at an area shelter simply because there was no space. A call from a concerned shelter staff member who knew of my volunteer work with cats resulted in their transfer to my care for fostering. Mandy and her kids would temporarily reside in a cage in the storefront window of a friend’s antique store on Asbury Avenue. They had many visitors, and many evenings people could be seen peering in the window to watch the kittens growing under mom's watchful eyes. The antique store evolved as a place for visitors to talk about family pets and to share stories and seek advice about stray cats. Mandy and all of her kittens found loving homes, the first of many successes to follow. </p>

        <p>This was the year 2007 and the beginnings of Cape-Atlantic Citizens Altering The Strays, better known in Cape May and Atlantic Counties as C.A.T.S., and a mission to save the lives of area cats and kittens.  In 2008 C.A.T.S. received 501(c)(3) status approval, leased 600 square feet of a Victorian house on Asbury Avenue and established Mew To You Resale Shoppe as a means to fund an aggressive spaying/neutering program. </p>

        <p>Presently, in 2016, you can find Mew To You in a completely renovated 2000 square foot store at 959 Asbury Avenue, the exact site of the original antique store where Mandy and her kittens were fostered. Rescued cats enjoy living cage-free in two fun rooms and interacting with visitors while waiting for homes. Cat lovers and supporters continue to donate wonderful items for resale, and a group of dedicated volunteers help in so many different ways with the cats and in the store.  C.A.T.S. has grown from helping a handful to 400+ cats and kittens yearly through rescue, foster, trap-neuter-return, any and all medical needs, and placement in caring, lifelong homes.</p>
